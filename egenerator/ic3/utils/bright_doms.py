class AddBrightDOMs(icetray.I3ConditionalModule):
    '''Module to add BrightDOMs for a given pulse series.

    BrightDOMs are DOMs which collect a large fraction of the event charge.
    These DOMs are not saturated and should in principle be correctly
    simulated. However, often when a single or only a few DOMs contain
    almost all of the event charge, this may be caused by an energy deposition
    in the close vicinity of that particular DOM. Systematic uncertainties
    on the hole-ice become more and more important, the closer the energy
    deposition is to the DOM. In addition, we often do not properly simulate
    energy depositions very close to DOMs due to DOM oversizing and an
    effective hole-ice parameterization as an angular acceptance curve.
